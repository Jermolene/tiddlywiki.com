This revision corrects a Unicode/~UTF-8 character encoding error that was present within the body of the jQuery 1.8.1 code that was used to build ~TW2.7.0.  ~TiddlyWiki documents that contain ~UTF-8 encoded characters (e.g., content in a non-Latin language) should now be properly recognized and processed without automatic (and incorrect) conversion of multi-byte sequences that had previously resulted in "mangled" content.
