This revision includes only ONE significant change: the internal embedded copy of the jQuery library has been updated from v1.8.1 to v1.8.3 in order to correct a Unicode/UTF-8 character encoding error that was present within TW2.7.0.  This update should allow documents containing UTF-8 encoded characters (e.g., content in a non-Latin language) to be more consistently recognized and saved/loaded without 'mangling' those UTF-8 encoded characters.
