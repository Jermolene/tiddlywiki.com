This is the PRE-RELEASE build of ~TiddlyWiki v<<version>>, and incorporates all changes currently committed to the [[TiddlyWiki source repository|http://github.com/tiddlywiki/tiddlywiki]], including several enhancements to key functions and objects, as well as an internal update to use a newer revision of jQuery (now v1.8.1)

~TiddlyWiki "Classic" uses ~TiddlyWiki5-based tools to assemble and output the core system, rather than the Ruby-based ginsu/cook utilities that were previously used.  The ability of ~TiddlyWiki5 to directly create ~TiddlyWiki Classic documents ensures a robust and reliable future for the existing "installed base" of ~TiddlyWiki, even as the community migrates to using the new power and flexiblity of ~TiddlyWiki5.
